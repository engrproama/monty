# What is Monty Interpreter

It is a language interpreter made in the C programming language to manage stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO). The aim is to interpret Monty bytecodes files. [Monty](http://montyscoconut.github.io/) is a language that aims to close the gap between scripting and programming languages.


## Requirements For This Project

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Editor was used too.
* All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90
* All files should end with a new line
* There is README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project. (You are Already Reading The ReadMe.)
* This code used the Betty style.
* A maximum of one global variable was used
* Not more than 5 functions per file rule was used
* The C standard library was not ignored.
* The prototypes of all functions were included in my header file called monty.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

## Compilation

To compile this project, you can use the following command:

```
$ make
```

## Allowed OpCodes With Explanations


|opcode  |  functionality|
| --- | --- |
| push | add element to the 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue  |
| pop  | remove element from 'top' of stack and 'end' of queue |
|pall  |print every member of the structure|
| pint | prints the member value at the top of stack |
| swap | swaps the order  of the 1st and 2nd elements in stack |
| add | add top two member values |
| sub | subtract the top element from the 2nd top element |
| div | divide the 2nd element by the top element |
| mul | multiply the top two elements of the stack |
| mod | the remainder when the 2nd element is divided by the top element |
| comment | there is the ability to parse comments found in bytecode ->'#'|
| pchar | print character at the top of the stack |
| pstr | print the character at the top of the stack|
| rotl | moves element at the top to the bottom of the stack |
| rotr | the bottom of the stack becomes the top |
| queue, stack | toggles the doubly link list implementation style |
| nop | opcode should do nothing |




Examples:
`$ cat opcodetestfile.m`

`push 1`

`push 2`

`push 3`

`pall`

`$ ./montyfile opcodetestfile.m`

`3`

`2`

`1`

`$`

---

`$ cat opcodetestfile.m`

`push 1`

## Exit Status
Exits with status `EXIT_FAILURE`


## Compilation
All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

All programs and functions were compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`.

## Styling
All files have been written in the Betty Style.
